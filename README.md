# Korean Skincare Recommender
 
Data used in this project was scraped from the Soko Glam website in September 2020. The nice thing about this website that made it an ideal candidate for this project is that users can browse product listings based on skin type, thereby also making it easy for me to scrape data based on those collections. This is so that I don't need to conduct additional research to determine if a product is best for which skin type (oily, dry, normal, combination.)

The main goal behind this project is build a Korean Skincare Recommender based on two objectives: ingredients only and ingredients with known skin type category. From personal experience, when I find a product that works well for my skin, I try to find if there are other products available in that line from that brand since all products in a particular line will mostly have the same ingredients.

This approach has worked well for me, but limits new product discovery. In other works, there could be a better product out there for my skin that I don't even know of. Thus, I wanted to try to build a recommender that takes in a product that a user already likes and/or is right for their skin type to discover new and similiar skincare products.
