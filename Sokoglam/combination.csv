Red Energy Recovery Serum,MAMONDE,"Mamonde's Red Energy Recovery Serum is a product 28 years in the making. In these last few decades, Mamonde researchers have zeroed in on how flowers bloom, grow, and survive even within harsh environments. This research ultimately led to the development of their unique ingredient, Blossoming Energy™, which harnesses the power of flowers to improve skin. Skin benefits include notable hydration, a boost in the skin’s barrier function, improved firmness, and clarity. Because the product also contains antioxidant-rich ingredients — including pomegranate extract and rosa canina fruit extract — it can also help ward off free radical damage to reduce and combat signs of premature aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, and hyper-pigmentation. What’s especially impressive about Red Energy Recovery Serum is how quickly it works. Clinical trials found that after five days of consistent use, skin moisture levels increased by 25.5%, texture improved by 9.2%, and the skin's barrier was strengthened by 11.5%. After two weeks of use, there was a 7.5% increase in firmness, 14.7% increase in glow, and 15.6% improvement in clarity.This product is formulated without animal ingredients, sulfates, mineral oil, parabens, and synthetic colors.1.01 fl. oz / 30 ml","Water/Aqua/Eau,Dimethicone, Alcohol, Glycerin, Propanediol, 1-2-Hexandediol, Betane, Niacinamide Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Butylene Glycol, Tranexamic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethylataurate/Vpcopolymer, Saccharide Isomerate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Methylglucose Distearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Caprylate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Adenosine, Sucrose, Fragranceparfum, Disodium Edta, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, Rosa Canna Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Indole Acetic Acid
